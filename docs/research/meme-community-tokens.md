# Solana Meme/Community Token Research

> Control Group Candidates for MetaDAO Holder Analytics Comparison

**Research Date:** February 2026  
**Purpose:** Identify community-driven tokens to compare holder distribution patterns against MetaDAO futarchy tokens and VC-backed tokens.

## Executive Summary

This document catalogs Solana meme/community tokens suitable as a control group for comparing holder distribution patterns across different governance models:
- **MetaDAO tokens** - Futarchy-based governance
- **VC-backed tokens** - Traditional venture capital backing
- **Community/meme tokens** - Grassroots, community-driven with no VC allocation

The key hypothesis: holder distribution patterns differ significantly between governance models, and meme tokens should show different concentration patterns than VC-backed tokens.

## Expected Distribution Patterns (Hypothesis)

| Category | Expected Gini | Expected Top 10% Concentration | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| **VC-backed** | Higher | Higher | Team/investor allocations create concentration |
| **MetaDAO** | Lower | Lower | Futarchy incentivizes participation distribution |
| **Community/Meme** | Medium | Medium | Fair launches but whale accumulation post-launch |

The control group should help validate whether MetaDAO's futarchy model produces meaningfully different holder distribution than both VC-backed AND purely community tokens.

---

## Next Steps

1. Add recommended tokens to `src/data/tokens.ts`
2. Fetch initial holder data via Solscan/Helius APIs
3. Calculate baseline distribution metrics (Gini, Nakamoto, HHI)
4. Create comparison dashboards
