# MetaDAO Ecosystem Tokens Research

**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Status:** Complete  
**Author:** Warp Agent

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive research on tokens in the MetaDAO ecosystem beyond the three currently tracked (META, FUTURE, DEAN). The MetaDAO ecosystem has expanded significantly with its "Futarchy as a Service" offering and ICO launchpad, creating multiple categories of tokens worth tracking.

---

## 1. Currently Tracked Tokens

| Token | Symbol | Mint Address | CoinGecko ID | Category |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| MetaDAO | META | `METAwkXcqyXKy1AtsSgJ8JiUHwGCafnZL38n3vYmeta` | `meta-dao` | Core Governance |
| FUTURE | FUTURE | `FUTURETnhzFApq2TiZiNbWLQDXMx4nWNpFtQCRKzEdvk` | — | Conditional Token |
| Dean's List | DEAN | `Ds52CDgqdWbTWsua1hgT3AuSSy4FNx2Sf6fDJVxEFSpa` | `dean-s-list` | Ecosystem DAO |

---

## 2. MetaDAO ICO Launchpad Tokens

These tokens launched through MetaDAO's "Unruggable ICO" platform and are governed by futarchy from day one.

### 2.1 Omnipair (OMFG)

**Category:** ICO Launch / DeFi Protocol

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | OMFG |
| Mint Address | `omfgRBnxHsNJh6YeGbGAmWenNkenzsXyBXm3WDhmeta` |

**Description:** Omnipair is a decentralized trading and lending protocol on Solana using a Generalized Automated Market Maker (GAMM) model. It supports permissionless spot and margin markets without external oracles.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY** - Active trading, significant holder base, meaningful volume. Would add diversity to tracked ecosystem tokens.

---

### 2.2 Umbra (UMBRA)

**Category:** ICO Launch / Privacy Protocol

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | UMBRA |
| Mint Address | `PRVT6TB7uss3FrUd2D9xs2zqDBsa3GbMJMwCQsgmeta` |
| CoinGecko ID | `umbra` |
| Launch Date | October 10, 2025 |
| ICO Raised | $3M (from $154.9M committed - ~19x oversubscribed) |
| Approximate Holders | ~7,260 |
| Market Cap | ~$11-22M |
| 24h Volume | ~$1M |
| Trading Status | Active on Meteora, MetaDAO AMM, Manifest |

**Description:** Privacy protocol powered by Arcium bringing confidential transactions to Solana. One of the most successful ICOs on MetaDAO with 10,518 participants.

---

### 2.3 mtnCapital (MTN)

**Category:** ICO Launch / Investment Fund

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | MTN |
| Mint Address | `mtnc7NNSpAJuvYNmayXU63WhWZGgFzwQ2yeYWqemeta` |
| CoinGecko ID | — (Not listed) |

**Description:** First ICO on MetaDAO's launchpad. Investment fund that ultimately redeemed treasury and returned funds to holders - demonstrating the "unruggable" mechanism works in practice.

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **LOW PRIORITY** - Historical significance but fund has been unwound. Low volume and holder count. Worth tracking for research purposes only.

---

## 3. DAOs Using MetaDAO's Futarchy Governance

These established Solana protocols use MetaDAO's futarchy system for governance decisions. They have their own governance tokens that could be tracked as "futarchy-adjacent" tokens.

### 3.1 Drift Protocol (DRIFT)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | DRIFT |
| Mint Address | `DriFtupJYLTosbwoN8koMbEYSx54aFAVLddWsbksjwg7` |
| CoinGecko ID | `drift-protocol` |

| Holders | 200K+ |
| Market Cap | ~$300M+ |

**Description:** Leading perpetual DEX on Solana. Uses MetaDAO for grant decisions like Superteam Earn funding.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Major protocol using futarchy. Already has VC-backed characteristics.

---

### 3.2 Sanctum (CLOUD)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | CLOUD |
| Mint Address | `CLoUDKc4Ane7HeQcPpE3YHnznRxhMimJ4MyaUqyHFzAu` |
| CoinGecko ID | `sanctum-2` |
| Futarchy Usage | Governance decisions under discussion |
| Market Cap | ~$150M+ |

**Description:** LST (Liquid Staking Token) infrastructure protocol. Experimenting with futarchy governance for community decisions.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Growing futarchy adoption, significant protocol.

---

### 3.3 Marinade Finance (MNDE)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | MNDE |
| Mint Address | `MNDEFzGvMt87ueuHvVU9VcTqsAP5b3fTGPsHuuPA5ey` |
| CoinGecko ID | `marinade` |
| Futarchy Usage | MNDE buyback proposals |
| Market Cap | ~$50M+ |

**Description:** Largest liquid staking protocol on Solana. Has passed futarchy proposals for MNDE buybacks.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Major staking protocol with active futarchy usage.

---

### 3.4 Jito (JTO)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | JTO |
| Mint Address | `jtojtomepa8beP8AuQc6eXt5FriJwfFMwQx2v2f9mCL` |
| CoinGecko ID | `jito-governance-token` |
| Futarchy Usage | Experimental governance |
| Market Cap | ~$500M+ |

**Note:** Already tracked in `VC_TOKENS` array.

---

### 3.5 ORE

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | ORE |
| Mint Address | `oreoU2P8bN6jkk3jbaiVxYnG1dCXcYxwhwyK9jSybcp` |
| CoinGecko ID | `ore` |
| Futarchy Usage | Governance decisions |
| Holders | ~30K+ |
| Market Cap | ~$74M |

**Description:** Proof-of-work token mineable on Solana. Uses MetaDAO for governance.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Unique PoW mechanism, good holder count.

---

### 3.6 Flash Trade (FAF)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Symbol | FAF |
| Mint Address | `FAFaxK9wpw1bvF8YfVz1vPxjLbtPMQ35P1jLsPNtpump` |
| CoinGecko ID | `flash-trade` |
| Futarchy Usage | Revenue distribution proposals |
| Market Cap | ~$20M |

**Description:** Decentralized perpetuals exchange on Solana. Uses futarchy for business decisions.

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Active futarchy user but smaller market cap.

---

## 4. Conditional Tokens (PASS/FAIL)

### How They Work

MetaDAO creates **PASS** and **FAIL** conditional tokens for each governance proposal:

1. Traders deposit USDC and receive both PASS and FAIL tokens
2. During 3-day voting period, traders buy/sell based on beliefs
3. If PASS token TWAP > FAIL token TWAP by threshold, proposal passes
4. Winning side redeems tokens for USDC; losing side tokens expire worthless

### Technical Details

- PASS/FAIL tokens are **ephemeral** - created per proposal and burn after resolution
- They exist for ~3 days during voting periods
- No persistent mint addresses - dynamically generated per proposal
- Traded on MetaDAO's Futarchy AMM

**Recommendation:** ❌ **NOT TRACKABLE** - Conditional tokens are transient and proposal-specific. Not suitable for long-term holder analytics. However, understanding this mechanism is important for contextualizing the ecosystem.

---

## 5. LP Tokens

### MetaDAO Futarchy AMM LP Tokens

MetaDAO operates its own AMM for trading futarchy tokens. LP positions exist but are:
- Generally wrapped in the protocol's smart contracts
- Not tradeable as independent tokens
- Primarily used for proposal liquidity requirements

**Recommendation:** ❌ **NOT TRACKABLE** - LP tokens are protocol-internal and not meaningful for holder analytics.

---

## 6. Futarchy-Adjacent Projects (Non-MetaDAO)

### 6.1 Polymarket (Polygon/Ethereum)

Not on Solana - uses conditional tokens on Polygon for prediction markets. Different architecture.

### 6.2 Gnosis (Ethereum)

Historical futarchy research but not active on Solana.

---

## 7. Summary Recommendations

### High Priority (Add to Registry)

| Token | Symbol | Justification |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Omnipair** | OMFG | Active ICO launch, good volume, ~1.3K holders |
| **Umbra** | UMBRA | Largest ICO success, ~7.3K holders, high volume |

### Medium Priority (Consider Adding)

| Token | Symbol | Justification |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Drift** | DRIFT | Major protocol using futarchy |
| **Sanctum** | CLOUD | Growing futarchy adoption |
| **Marinade** | MNDE | Active futarchy governance |
| **ORE** | ORE | Unique PoW + futarchy combination |

### Low Priority / Research Only

| Token | Symbol | Justification |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **mtnCapital** | MTN | Historical, fund unwound |
| **Flash Trade** | FAF | Smaller scale |

### Not Trackable

- **Conditional tokens** (PASS/FAIL) - Ephemeral, per-proposal
- **LP tokens** - Protocol-internal

## 10. Next Steps

1. **Implement high-priority additions** (OMFG, UMBRA) in `src/data/tokens.ts`
2. **Create new token category** for futarchy-adopting DAOs
3. **Add holder count endpoints** for new tokens via Helius/Solscan APIs
4. **Monitor MetaDAO launchpad** for future ICOs to track
5. **Consider governance proposal tracking** as a separate analytics feature
